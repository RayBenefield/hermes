# Work Log

## #3

So I realized during my walk that I needed to re-think how I was creating the
use cases. The use cases should really be around the platform/domain not around
the interface itself. That will be what the interface design is for. So I made
some solid progress on starting up a game and am working towards the use cases
revolving around actual play. Shouldn't take me more than 2 more sessions to
finish up the use case design. Which after that I'll probably take a break for
Breakfast and then after Breakfast I'll tackle interface design. And hopefully
finish interface design by Lunch time and then start the initial coding after
Lunch.

Current progress on the new use cases:

## #2

So I organized all of the brainstorming ideas that I had into Product,
Technology, and Executive groups. Then I started working on the use cases. It is
going to prove to be a fairly long process as it is a mix of both UI interaction
for the user and domain management.

Current progress on use cases:

## #1

I started out with a brainstorming session for Hermes. Setup the initial
directory structure for the project to track all artifacts and code. Getting
ready to start working on the use case design after brainstorm organization.

Here is a snapshot of the brainstorming:
