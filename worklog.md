# Work Log

## #2

So I organized all of the brainstorming ideas that I had into Product,
Technology, and Executive groups. Then I started working on the use cases. It is
going to prove to be a fairly long process as it is a mix of both UI interaction
for the user and domain management.

Current progress on use cases:

## #1

I started out with a brainstorming session for Hermes. Setup the initial
directory structure for the project to track all artifacts and code. Getting
ready to start working on the use case design after brainstorm organization.

Here is a snapshot of the brainstorming:
